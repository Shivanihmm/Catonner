                   <h2>Uwuki-The gay cat</h2>
                   <p>
                  The major ikemen gay cat of the neighbourhood who broke a lot of hearts after he came
                  out of the closet.He has the best furcare routine better than that of a female and
                  all the other cats take advice from him.He flirts with most of the male cats which
                  made it hard to percieve what his type of cat is.There is a 
                   rumor that his eyes are of different shades because
                  a star is said to have fallen in one of his eyes.If you want keep him away from you ...just
                  have bad furcare routine or be really bad at cooking.
