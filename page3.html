                   <h2>Dr.Bazinga cat</h2>
                   <p>
                    Bazinga cat is just his nickname that he gave to himself because he thought he is funny.
                    He is known for being very picky and hard to deal with. It's a surprise that he even
                    has any friends to begin with.He precieves that most of the cat-kind is just stupid.
                    He is a walking randomly popping notification of facts which we never wanted to 
                    know most of the time.But he is not actually that bad and he is also like a deer 
                    on headlights most of the time.
