                   <h2>Ellay-The vampire</h2>
                   <p>
                   During the 18's vampires were a growing concern.No one knew how a cat would
                   get away with killing other cats without getting caught.But the chances
                   of them getting caught were slim as they belonged to one of the noble family 
                   that of a Marquess.Ellay was a cat that grew up in that household who never 
                   had the luxury of going out on a sunny day since her childhood which led
                   her to wish for a day to come where she bask in the sunlight.Though blood is her only
                   source of food,she has an innocent dream.
